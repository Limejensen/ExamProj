#Feature: Budget Management
#As a project leader
#I want to edit budgeted time for activities
#So that budget allocations reflect actual project needs

#Scenario: Edit budgeted time
#    Given an activity "Requirements Analysis" has a budget of 50 hours
#    When I update the budget to 75 hours
#    Then the system should reflect the new budgeted time
